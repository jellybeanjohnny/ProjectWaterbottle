# Project Waterbottle #

The goal of this app is to offer a tool for learning languages. I am designing it with the [AJATT method](http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/) of learning languages in mind. It will offer three main services:

1. An app extension that allows the user to take text from some other app context and import it into this app. 
2. An editing and creation tool for making flashcards to be used with a spaced repetition flashcard program.
3. The actual SRS.
